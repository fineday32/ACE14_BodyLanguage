% We propose a game design pattern for body language. Under this game design, 

We are the first one to define the problem that cooperative game would be frustrating while playing with differnet language speaker. We suggest a solution to use body language as a communication manner. Thus we present a game prototype, Mute Robot, using body language in cooperative game design. Our user study shows that with body language consistency, player will get more similar game experience, and body langeuage also enhances fun and enjoyment. According to our final questionnaire, only 17\% and 25\% (different language group and common language group) player choose traditional communication manner (speaking) as the favorite manner. And we also observe some interesting communication patterns. Game developer can make a better game experience with these information. We hope to inspire more exploration of using body language in game designs and spread game entertainment for more people.
