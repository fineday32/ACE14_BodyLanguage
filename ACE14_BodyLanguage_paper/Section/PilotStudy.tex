\section{Pilot Study}

To understand how language boundary affect cooperative game experience, we recruit 9 Taiwaneses and 3 Japaneses and divided into 2 separate group-types(i)Taiwan-Taiwan, (ii)Taiwan-Japan. We have validated that Taiwanese players donâ€™t understand Japanese and vise versa. We choose three different cooperative games on Steam[1] (so that player can talk to each other through Steam Talk), Rocketbirds:Hardboiled Chicken(Cooperative Action Game) ,Portal 2 (Cooperative Puzzle Game), Monaco (Cooperative Stealth Game).To emulate quick match via Internet, two players are playing these games at two distinct rooms using headphones for communication. Players play these three games 30 minutes for each. After playing each game, players will fill up an eSFQ[2] questionnaire for rapid assessment of game experiences and conduct an open-ended interviews.
