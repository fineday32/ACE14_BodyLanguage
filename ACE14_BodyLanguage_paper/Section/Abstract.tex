With the rapid development of Internet, it is common for players to play cooperative games from different country. 
We observed that playing cooperative game with different language speaker would cause frustrating game experience.
We suggest to use body language as a communication manner in cooperative game to get better game experience. 
We present a game prototype, Mute Robot, which implements cooperative game design through body language communication.
By using extended Short Feedback Questionnaire (eSFQ)\cite{eSFQ} and Cooperative Performance Metrics (CPMs)\cite{CPMs} to evaluate game experience, our user study results indicate that, using body language in cooperative game design would enhance original game experience and decrease 48\% frustrating caused by language boundary.
After adding the communication manner of body language, 83\% and 75\% (different language group and common language group) players choose our new communication manner (``body language'' and ``both'') as the favorite manner.
