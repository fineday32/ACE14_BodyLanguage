With the rapid development of Internet, it is common for players to play cooperative games from different country. 
we observed that playing cooperative game with different language speaker would cause frustrating game experience.
We suggest to use body language as a communication manner in cooperative game to get better game experience. 
We present a game prototype, Mute Robot, which implements cooperative game design through body language communication.
By using eSFQ\cite{eSFQ} and CPMs\cite{CPMs} to evaluate game experience, our user study results indicate that, using body language in cooperative game design would enhance original game experience and decrease 48\% frustrating caused by language boundary.
According to our final questionnaire, only 17\% and 25\% (different language group and common language group) player choose traditional communication manner (speaking) as the favorite manner.
